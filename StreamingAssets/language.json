    "UI-1-1-1": "Dr.Brown is teaching his students about chemical reactions",
    "UI-1-1-2": "Of course, there is no other pracitical way to learn than actually seeing different chemical reactions occurring in realtim",
    "UI-1-1-3": "Dr.Brown came up with a greate idea to let his students observe these chemical reactions in his chemical substrate incubator",
    "UI-1-1-4": "where chemical substrates flow from the ceiling to the floor and re-circulate to keep them fresh",
    "UI-1-1-5": "The wacky genius scientist and his students will all be wearing special designed protective gears",
    "UI-1-1-6": "It is important to adhere to safety precautions during chemical experiments",

    "UI-3-1-Header": "Color Change",
    "UI-3-1": "a color change in a substance \n can be evidence \n of a chemical reaction",
    "UI-3-1-2": "Let's start today lesson with Sodium Hydroxide, Hydrocholoric acid and Phenolphthalein reaction",
    "UI-3-1-3": "Dr.Brown, what is Phenolphthalein?",
    "UI-3-1-4": "Phenolphthalein is a universal indicator, which means it changes color to show the pH of certain solutions.",
    "UI-3-1-4-1": "Phenolphthalein stays colorless in acidic solutions and turns pink in alkaline solutions.",

    "UI-3-1-5-Header": "pH scale",
    "UI-3-1-5-1": "pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. ",
    "UI-3-1-5-2": "if the pH is less the 7 the solution is acidic \n if the pH is 7 the solution is neutral. \n if the pH is greater than 7 the solution is basic",

    "UI-3-1-6-1": "Put two equal amounts of phenolphthalein indicator",
    "UI-3-1-6-2": "Add the still water to both of them",

    "UI-3-1-6-3": "What do you observe the indicators color doesn't change",
    "UI-3-1-6-4": "Therefore phenolphthalein is colorless in the neutral medium",
    "UI-3-1-6-5": "Add some of sodium hydroxide solution to the indicator in the first test tube.",
    "UI-3-1-6-6": "What do you observe? The color of the indicator turns red.",
    "UI-3-1-6-7": "Therefore the phenolphthalein indicator turns red in the basic medium",
    "UI-3-1-6-8": "A drops of hydrochloric acid to the indicator in the second test tube",
    "UI-3-1-6-9": "What do you observe? The color of the indicator doesn't change and turn corlorless in the first tube.",
    "UI-3-1-6-10": "Therefore the phenolphthalein indicator is colorless in the acidic",

    "UI-3-1-7-1": "Let's apply our knowledge into a minigame",

    "UI-3-1-7-2": "Turn Phenolphthalein  to <color=white>White</color>",
    "UI-3-1-7-3": "Turn Phenolphthalein  to <color=#FF0090>Pink</color>",

    "UI-3-2-Header": "Temperature Change",
    "UI-3-2-1": "A temperature change in a substance can be evidence of a chemical reaction",

    "UI-3-2-2-1": "We will do exothermic and endothermic reactions in this lesson",
    "UI-3-2-2-2": "DrBrown, what is exothermic and endothermic reactions?",

    "UI-3-2-3-1": "An exothermic reaction gives off energy to the surroundings and this energy is usually heat energy",
    "UI-3-2-3-2": "They cause the surroundings to heat up, just like a bonfire keeping everyone warm",
    "UI-3-2-3-3": "Endothermic reactions take in energy from the surroundings.",
    "UI-3-2-3-4": "So in endothermic reactions the surrounding usually get colder",

    "UI-3-2-4-1-1": "Add water into",
    "UI-3-2-4-1-2": "Take the solid ammonium chloride which is a white crystalline solid poured into a beaker full of water and as it dissolves",

    "UI-3-2-4-2": "We'll see the temperature dropped quite radically",
    "UI-3-2-4-3": "Then we set up An exothermic reaction",
    "UI-3-2-4-4-SUB": "Add some water",
    "UI-3-2-4-4": "You dissolve calcium chloride in water.",
    "UI-3-2-4-5": "The calcium chloride solution gets hot then energy is released that energy goes into the water",
    "UI-3-2-4-6": "and so the temperature of the system goes up",

    "UI-3-2-7-3": "NH<sub>4</sub>Cl",
    "UI-3-2-7-2": "CaCL",

    "UI-3-3-Header": "Gas Release",
    "UI-3-3-1": "The release of a gas can be evidence of a chemical reaction",
    "UI-3-3-2-1": "We have a very interesting experiment called the Magic Balloons",
    "UI-3-3-2-2": "What's that reaction, professor?",
    "UI-3-3-2-3": "Let's do it together",

    "UI-3-4-1": "Carefully place the balloon half filled with Sodium bicarbonate over the neck of the Citric acid C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>7</sub> bottle",
    "UI-3-4-2": "Allow it to droop over to the side and making sure none of the Sodium bicarbonate falls into the bottle",
    "UI-3-4-3": "Lift the end of the balloon and pour the Sodium bicarbonate into the bottle",
    "UI-3-4-4": "Shake well and place the bottle on a table. Watch the balloon inflate all by itself!",

    "UI-3-4-5-1": "When you add Sodium Bicarbonate to the Citric Acid it causes a reaction.",
    "UI-3-4-5-2": "That reaction releases a gas called carbon dioxide (CO2).",
    "UI-3-4-5-3": "Because the balloon forms a seal around the bottle, the gas produced cannot escape, so it fills up the balloon.",

    "UI-3-4-7-1": "Blow up the balloon",



    "UI-3-5-Header": "Precipitate Formation",
    "UI-3-5-1": "The formation of a precipitate can be evidence of a chemical reaction.",
    "UI-3-5-2": "We're going to do a chemical reaction with a very familiar chemical, which is table salt",
    "UI-3-5-3-1": "here we've got our test tube filled with sodium chloride and we're gonna add some of our silver nitrate to the sodium chloride",
    "UI-3-5-3-2": "So what's going to happen ?",
    "UI-3-5-3-3": "when we add that silver nitrate to the sodium chloride solution, we can see there it forms this milky substance",

    "UI-3-5-4-1": "When the sodium chloride solution is added to the silver nitrate solution, a white precipitate, insoluble silver chloride, is formed."
